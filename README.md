# AUmi example

This project is an example of [AUmi](https://github.com/atom-yang/aumi), use this as a template to create a new project, both can use [Umi](https://umijs.org/en-US/docs/introduce/introduce) and [Rsbuild](https://rsbuild.dev/guide/start/index#-features)

## Getting Started

### Installation

Better using pnpm

```bash
pnpm install
```

Yarn or npm are both accepted to install.

### Bootstrap

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Follow the instructions in [Umi](https://umijs.org/en-US/docs/guides/getting-started#start-the-project) documentation, [AUmi](https://github.com/atom-yang/aumi) simply switches the bundler from `Webpack` to `Rsbuild`, ensuring you can use `AUmi` in the same way as `Umi`.
